        <h3> Ingredients </h3>
        <ol>
            <li>2 cups whole wheat flour</li>
            <li>1 1/2 cups all purpose bleached flour</li>
            <li>1 1/4 teaspoons baking soda</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon baking powder</li>
            <li>1/2 teaspoon salt</li>
            <li>3 tablespoon sugar</li>
            <li>5 tablespoons chilled unsalted butter, cut into chunks</li>
            <li>1 1/3 cups buttermilk</li>
            <li>1 large egg, room temperature</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon vanilla extract</li>
            <li>2 tablespoon wheat bran</li>
        </ol>
       <div>
           <h3> Recipe Directions </h3>
        </div>
        <p> Preheat the oven to 375 degrees. Line a heavy baking sheet with parchment paper. </p>
        <p>
Sift the whole-wheat flour, all-purpose flour, baking soda, baking powder and salt into a large mixing bowl. Add the sugar and whisk to combine. Drop in the chunks of butter; use a pastry blender or two rounded table knives to cut the butter into the flour mixture until it is reduced to flakes and pea-size bits.</p>
        <p> Whisk together the buttermilk, egg and vanilla extract in a small mixing bowl. </p>

        <p>Pour the buttermilk mixture over the flour mixture and stir to form a dough, which will be moist and come together in large patches. Use your clean hands to gather and form the dough into a mass that adheres to itself. Do not knead or overwork the dough; that would yield a densely textured crumb.</p>
        <p>Sprinkle a work surface with the wheat bran. Transfer the dough to the work surface; gently smooth and roll the dough into a well-domed sphere that is 5 to 5 1/2 inches in diameter, allowing it to take up a light coating of the bran; the bran will adhere to the dough randomly. </p>

        <p>Transfer the dough ball to the center of the baking sheet. Use a small sharp knife to cut a shallow 4-by-4-inch cross on top of the bread. (If the cut is deeper than 1/4 inch, it will allow the loaf to bake out of shape. If that happens, reduce the baking time by about 4 minutes.) Bake for 40 minutes or until set. The baked bread will sound hollow when gently tapped on the bottom. Let the bread stand on the baking sheet for 2 minutes, then transfer the loaf to a cooling rack. </p>
            
        <p>Serve barely warm or at room temperature. Store in an airtight container for up to 2 days.</p>
